GST-Webpage
===========
'About us' webpage for GST using html+css 

This is a basic front-end to a webpage about the Google Students Team, MIT. I have used basic html and css to create the webpage. 
Since this is my first attempt at web-designing, I have not been able to incorporate exactly what I had in mind, especially with 
the positioning and alignment of the logo with the heading.
